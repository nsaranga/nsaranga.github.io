I"k<p>Michael Hanekeâ€™s, Amour, is unequivocally a masterpiece of modern cinema and most definitely one of the best films of 2012. The narrative is both clear and yet cinematically dense. Two things that are often difficult to produce on screen. The performances, particularly of the two leads, Emmanuelle Riva and Jean-Louis Trintignant, are realistic, subtle and seemingly effortless. Both performances communicate in volumes about the characters. The sound design is used not just for loud effects but to mark returning metaphors seamlessly. This post does does contain some spoilers about the climax in the film.</p>
