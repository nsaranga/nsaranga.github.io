Hi! I'm Saranga Sudarshan, and you've landed at my personal website. I received my PhD from the University of St Andrews and University of Stirling in 2020 for my thesis, *Disagreement, Concepts and Convergence: A New Theory of Political Realist Legitimacy*. During my PhD I spent half a year at the University of Arizona working with Gerald Gaus. Before doing a PhD I was a Research Analyst at Frost & Sullivan in Sydney, and before that I did an MPhil and a BA (Hons) at the Univeristy of Sydney.

<!-- My thesis, *Disagreement, Concepts and Convergence: A New Theory of Political Realist Legitimacy* argued for a novel conception of political realism as a theory of political legitimacy, the 'Dual Convergent Conception', by making use of recent innovations in the philosophy of language on metalinguistic negotiations, and in developmental psychology on the nature of concepts. You can read my thesis here.
