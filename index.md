Hi! I'm Saranga Sudarshan, and you've landed at my personal website. Currently I am a Course Quality Support Officer at Western Sydney University. Before that I did a PhD at the University of St Andrews where I worked on theories of legitimacy, political realism and political liberalism. During my PhD I spent half a year at the University of Arizona working with Gerald Gaus. Before that I was a Research Analyst at Frost & Sullivan in Sydney, and before that I did an MPhil and a BA (Hons) at the University of Sydney.

Recently I have got into cricket statistics and data analysis. As part of that I wrote an open-source python module called [cricketstats](https://github.com/nsaranga/cricketstats) that can get cricket statistics for players and team from the cricsheet.org json cricket database for cricket anlaytics tasks. I welcome anyone to use it, suggest new features and find bugs.

<!-- My thesis, *Disagreement, Concepts and Convergence: A New Theory of Political Realist Legitimacy* argued for a novel conception of political realism as a theory of political legitimacy, the 'Dual Convergent Conception', by making use of recent innovations in the philosophy of language on metalinguistic negotiations, and in developmental psychology on the nature of concepts. You can read my thesis here.
