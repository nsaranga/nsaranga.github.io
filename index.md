Hi! I'm Saranga Sudarshan, and you've landed at my personal website. Most recently I did a PhD at the University of St Andrews and University of Stirling in 2020 with my thesis, *Disagreement, Concepts and Convergence: A New Theory of Political Realist Legitimacy*. During my PhD I spent half a year at the University of Arizona working with Gerald Gaus. Before all that I was a Research Analyst at Frost & Sullivan in Sydney, and before that I did an MPhil and a BA (Hons) at the University of Sydney.

<!-- My thesis, *Disagreement, Concepts and Convergence: A New Theory of Political Realist Legitimacy* argued for a novel conception of political realism as a theory of political legitimacy, the 'Dual Convergent Conception', by making use of recent innovations in the philosophy of language on metalinguistic negotiations, and in developmental psychology on the nature of concepts. You can read my thesis here.
