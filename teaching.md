I am fond of teaching philosophy, especially at an undergraduate level. My areas of teaching specialisation are Moral and Political Philosophy, Applied Ethics, and Introductory Logic. My areas of teaching competence are, philosophy language, metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of mind.

As a Tutor, my experience is in small-group teaching (5--10 students) for undergraduate modules in moral and political philosophy. This primarily involved teaching a mix of foundational moral philosophy (eg. Utilitarianism, Kantian Deontology, Contractualism and Virtue Ethics), applied ethics topics (eg. abortion and animal rights), and foundational political philosophy (eg. Liberalism, Democratic Theory, Distributive Justice, and Multiculturalism). I have also tutored undergraduate modules in introductory classical logic, philosophy of language, epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind.

As a Lecturer, my experience is in undergraduate lecturing (50--100 students) in political philosophy and applied ethics. In political philosophy, I lectured on the first-year PY1011 Moral and Political Controversies" module on Rawlsian Political Liberalism and its differences from Millian Liberalism and Libertarianism. In Applied Ethics, I lectured on the ethics of Capital Punishment, and the ethics of Wealth Inheritance in the St Andrews International Summer School Programme.

My approach to teaching is to prepare students to do what philosophers do in published work. This means preparing them to situate a problem within a dialectic and respond to the problem by building arguments, objections and eventually larger theories. This is in contrast to teaching students general points, abstract principles or insights (as good as they maybe) about a philosophical topic or question. As such my approach to teaching is oriented towards students thinking and writing as contemporary philosophers do. On this approach the methodology of philosophy is represented as one of general theory choice to solve certain common problems. I find this general approach places students in good stead to see themselves as in a continuum with past philosophers and then to construct rigorous arguments in their work.
